## Description

The `RSA-Factoring-Challenge` repository focuses on the RSA Factoring Challenge, which is a cryptographic challenge to factorize large composite numbers that are used in the RSA encryption algorithm. The repository includes code, algorithms, and resources related to factoring large numbers.

## Installation

To use the code in this repository, you need to have a programming language installed on your machine that supports large number calculations and algorithms for factoring. You can use languages such as Python, C, or Java.

Once you have the required programming language installed, you can clone this repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/x86skwizer/RSA-Factoring-Challenge.git
```

## Usage

After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd RSA-Factoring-Challenge
```

Inside the directory, you will find code files and resources related to factoring large numbers. The code files may include algorithms such as Pollard's rho algorithm, quadratic sieve algorithm, or other factoring algorithms.

Feel free to explore the code and modify it to suit your needs. You can run the code files using the appropriate commands for the programming language you are using.
